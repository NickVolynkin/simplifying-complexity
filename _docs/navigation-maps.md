The guiding principles most technical writers take when documenting a system is to identify tasks and then approach the tasks with individual steps. This is a fundamental way that we simplify complex operations.

My daughter recently had a book on drawing out, and I noticed the approach was pretty similar to techniques in tech comm.

Here she's learning to draw "Dogman." To simplify the task of drawing Dogman, the author has broken the process out into about 25 steps:

The idea is basic but brilliant. If you were to just show a picture of Dogman and say "Here's what you need to draw," the "user" might get confused. So instead, we break down the process into little individual steps. How many steps? The more you want to simplify complexity, the more steps you create.

For example, if someone were really new to drawing, there might be some additional steps:

* Get a blank sheet of paper
* Sharpen your pencil
* Find a hard surface to put the paper on
* Hold your pencil near the end between your thumb and two fingers
* Start drawing in the middle of the page, and so on.

My daughter was able to successfully follow the steps and create Dogman:

Steps are an ingenious way of taking something really complicated and making it doable. The same process scales to nearly anything. For example, suppose I wanted to assemble my own bicycle (a task more difficult than drawing Dogman). I would start by looking for a series of steps to follow that would simplify the task. What do I do first? Then second, and third, and so forth until I finish the bike.

If I were creating instructions on assembling a bike, I would group the steps into various sections. For example:

Assemble the cranks
1. step one
2. step two
3. step three

Assemble the drivetrain
1. step one
2. step two
3. step three

Assemble the brakes
1. step one
2. step two
3. step three

Assemble the wheels
1. step one
2. step two
3. step three

Now suppose each one of these processes has quite a lot of detail, such that each task spans several pages of information. To show a process that involves steps detailed on multiple pages, I would create several different pages, and then link the pages together with a map.

Here are some examples in recent projects I've worked on. Most of these maps show different steps in a process.
