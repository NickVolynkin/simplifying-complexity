Look at the mental models users have for the topics you're writing about, and make your new information conform to the expectations in the genre. Look for opportunities to structure information around their user journey through the space, as this will provide a more natural organization of information.

In previous topics, I analyzed how [integrating new information into the larger landscape](http://idratherbewriting.com/simplifying-complexity/ensuring-information-harmony-in-the-larger-documentation-landscape.html), and conversely [distilling information from a larger landscape into smaller units](http://idratherbewriting.com/simplifying-complexity/reduction-layering-distillation.html), both help to reduce the complexity information. In this article, I'll dive into another technique for simplifying complexity: making information fit the pattern or schema that the mind seeks. Our mind constantly filters the events, objects, and information around us by ignoring irrelevant information and fitting the important details into mental schemas. These schemas allow us to operate efficiently in what would otherwise be a complex chaos of incoming sensory information. As such, using these schemas simplifies the user experience.

One approach for fitting information into the user's mental schemas is to look at genre conventions and user expectations, and then follow these same conventions and expectations in the new information. However, this approach does little to exceed expectations in a genre of dissatisfied and frustrated users. A better approach is to fit information into a larger user journey that looks from beginning to end across topics, rather than focusing on one specific topic. This larger, more encompassing journey contains more of a story arc that resonates on a universal level with users. Regardless of the schema, story seems to be fundamental to how the brain is wired.

## How I first started exploring this topic

Recently, at work I was asked to do a competitive analysis of a competing product. I'd never actually written a competitive analysis before, and I started by gathering as much information as I could about the competitive product. I reviewed previous analyses on similar topics, looked at developer surveys, read feedback, ran through sample scenarios, and more. After about a week, I had a long file that contained seemingly endless notes on a variety of topics. My notes were a jumble of observations, questions, details, half-written sentences, screenshots, references, and other information that I'd been gathering as I forayed through the competitor's product and app submission experience.

I knew I needed to structure this jumble of information in a way that would make sense to users. This is a task we all face when confronted with large amounts of information that we need to organize and present to users. I face similar scenarios whenever I'm giving presentations or even when writing posts like this one. What principle do we use to group, structure, explain, and otherwise present large bodies of information in ways that makes sense to users? What does it mean for the information to "make sense" to users in the first place? What is the structure that will both engage the user and naturally present the information in a smooth, seamless flow?

## Script and prototype theory

My friend Kirk St. Amant, a tech comm professor in New Orleans, tipped me off to a helpful article he'd recently written. In the latest edition of *Communication Design Quarterly*, Kirk argues that "script theory" can be a good technique for making complex spaces more usable. Script theory, a term from psychology, refers to the routines and behavior we follow automatically and somewhat unconsciously in different spaces and situations.

For example, when checking into a hotel, you go in with certain expectations about where to go, what will be asked of you, what you will do and receive, etc., and usually you don't have to think about these expectations or what will be expected. All of this is already scripted out for you, and you just follow along with the script.

By following the expected script for the space, you help users naturally move about and operate in that space more easily. Following the expected conventions allows users to easily filter out the immensity of detail of a new space (the hotel layout, new faces, lighting, noise, etc.) and get their task done efficiently. St. Amant explains,

> These reflexive expectations of behavior in a setting are connected to a cognitive construction called *scripts*. Scripts are a kind of situational response we associate with a particular environment, and how the reflexive reactions associated with a space are connected to how humans perceive information (Tomkins, 1978, 1987; Norman 2002; St. Amant 2017).

Years of experience in certain spaces or situations builds up expectations for those spaces and situations. When your design matches those expectations, users can naturally plug into the workflow and process the objects and information in that space in an almost unconscious way, fitting the information into the mental model they've already formed. What might otherwise be a complex experience &mdash; figuring out where to check in, who to ask, what to present, how long it will take, what information you need, what will be asked of you, etc. &mdash; is minimized because the experience has already been scripted, so the mind doesn't need to figure it out from scratch.

Driving along the freeway has similar scripts in place. How can users go 65 MPH on a congested highway, navigating through multiple lanes, exits, loops, and other sophisticated traffic patterns with so few accidents? The freeway provides a predictable experience that aligns with user expectations, which reduces the amount of cognitive attention drivers must devote to the task. As a result, you can listen to an audio book while driving, and also munch away on  food at the same time.

Every genre has certain expectations around it. The expectations are built up from past experiences in that genre. Instead of physical spaces, consider texts. There are common conventions across genres that users expect, and when you align your text with these genre conventions, you make it easier for users to find, navigate, and absorb the information. St. Amant says, "when we generate texts -- such as user manuals or instruction sets -- we could be using a mental model of how elements in that space are organized to guide what we write."

The focus of St. Amant's article is on the user experience of spaces in healthcare facilities, not so much texts, but the same principle applies. "By catering my design to meeting your experiences," St. Amant says, "I make these items easier for you to use in that context." In short, aligning with the genre convention reduces complexity for users and makes their experience more natural and intuitive.

## Expectations in the documentation genre

One of the first steps to organizing and presentation information, therefore, is to understand the expected conventions in the genre. With some genres, the information has such a strong convention that going against it would create confusion and disorientation. In an article on the usability of medication information, Henk Pander Maat and Leo Lentz explain that European regulations required a specific template for information that didn't align with user expectations in the medication information genre. As a result, users had trouble locating the information. Maat and Lentz explain:

> Text genres come with corresponding genre schemata or move structures, specifying what will be discussed and in what order. Genre conventions serve readers by providing a collectively shared shorthand for interpreting information (Kostelnick & Hasset, 2003). They help readers scan a page and identify relevant information on the basis of structural expectations. For instance, an experienced reader of scientific articles in the experimental tradition is thoroughly acquainted with their structure (Swales, 1990), and the same goes for book reviews (Toledo, 2005), and application letters (e.g., Henry & Roseberry, 2001; Upton & Connor, 2001), to mention just a few well-established text genres. ([Using Sorting Data to Evaluate Text Structure: An Evidence-based Proposal for Restructuring Patient Information Leaflets](https://www.stc.org/techcomm/2011/09/27/using-sorting-data-to-evaluate-text-structure-an-evidence-based-proposal-for-restructuring-patient-information-leaflets/), *Technical Communication*, 58.3, AUGUST 2011)

For the many different genres of information &mdash; scientific articles, book reviews, recipes, personal essays, press releases, white papers, sales reports, help topics, blog posts, etc. &mdash; there are conventions that users expect (whether they're aware of them or not), and by following these genre conventions, users can more easily locate, navigate, and make use of the information.

Shifting away from healthcare and medication genres, what expectations are there for help topics in the genre of technical documentation? In [What Makes Up a Procedure?], Hans van der Meij, Peter Blijleven, and LeanneJansen review "data from 52 software manuals and 52 hardware manuals" to identify the common characteristics of help topics in this genre. Building on work by David Farkas, who in turn was building upon systems theory, the authors explain:

> Systems theory led Farkas (1999) to the construction of a prototypical or 'streamlined-step' procedure. The streamlined-step procedure consists of five components: a title that introduces and briefly explains the goal of a procedure; a conceptual element that elaborates the goal; an infinitive subheading that clarifies the purpose of subgoals; steps with action statements and system responses; and notes that present information that lies outside the main flow of the procedure (e.g., warnings). ([What Makes Up a Procedure?]())

Systems theory refers to an analysis of inputs and outputs in a system. In a help system, users have desired states they want to reach. These states require certain inputs, and based on the inputs, different outputs or results occur. These authors build on Farkas' research to present a similar model for help information called the Four Components model.

> The publication of a taxonomy of procedural discourse by David Farkas (1999) helped us create an enlightening domain-related organization. The Four Components model of a procedure that we advance here suggests that procedures are basically made up of the following components: goals, prerequisite states, unwanted states (warnings and problem-solving information), and actions & reactions.

The model here shouldn't come as a surprise, and instead only confirms expectations about our experience with help topics. (Otherwise, the model wouldn't provide the protoype for genre conventions.) Hans van der Meij, who recently won the Horace Hockley award and reflects on his contributions to the field in ISTC, says he "spent hundreds upon hundreds of hours analysing the products of technical communicators" to arrive at this Four Components model ([ISTC Spring 2016](https://www.scribd.com/document/302871252/Communicator-Dr-Hans-van-der-Meij).

## Room for innovation in some genres

I support the movement here to align with genre conventions and craft help content that aligns with these four components. Certainly, including goals, prerequisites, unwanted states (including problem-solving info), and actions & reactions in documentation leads to good help information. But at the same time, fulfilling the expectations of the technical documentation genre seems to discourage innovation in an area where more innovation would be welcome.

Consider this rather crass analogy. You're driving cross-country and need to stop at a rest area to use the bathroom. Since you're in the middle of nowhere, you expect this rest area facility to probably have a very primitive toilet, maybe even just a septic tank and no actual plumbing. If so, you expect the experience to be smelly and gross, with flies on the wall and perhaps hand sanitizer instead of running water and a sink. You might expect some graffiti carved into the wall by bored travelers, and some mostly empty vending machines that have a couple of options.

If you were designing a rest area facility, then, by following genre conventions, you wouldn't have a high bar to meet. In fact, genre conventions almost guarantee that you can get by with a low-budget experience here that, while not impressing anyone, would surprise anyone either.

In some ways, documentation is in also in a genre that could use some improvement. Given the reluctance and disdain users have in opening documentation to learn a system, the experience is not too unlike the traveler stopping at a remote rest area facility. Expectations are low, so why just fulfill these low expectations? In our genre, we should be more open to improving and fixing these bad experiences. Therefore, we have to move past simply fulfilling user expectations and reach for something better.

## From scripts to schema

With the goal for deeper connection, let's move past scripts theory and genre conventions to something a bit deeper: schemas in the mind. Suppose that rather than just matching expected conventions, we could actually construct and shape documentation to fit the lattice upon which the mind is constructed?

In scholarly fields, theorists call these lattices of the mind "schemas." Schemas are the patterns the mind uses to organize information. Put another way,

> A schema is a cognitive framework or concept that helps organize and interpret information. Schemas can be useful because they allow us to take shortcuts in interpreting the vast amount of information that is available in our environment. ([What Is a Schema in Psychology?](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-a-schema-2795873))

Let's make schemas more clear through a technical analogy. When you create an RSS feed, like the one [here](http://idratherbewriting.com/feed.xml), the information is arranged in a structure like this:

         <description>
            My 13-year-old daughter and her classmate recently created a math game designed for fifth grade students learning variables. They used Codesters, which is a website that uses Python to let kids code directly in the browser in an easy-to-learn way.

I could have more elements here, but they are irrelevant to the RSS schema. RSS readers like Feedly look at the feed elements, specifically the `title`, `description`, and other elements, and they ignore everything else. They pull that information into a framework for display.

There are lots of different schemas for different types of information. iTunes has its own schema for podcasts, and media platforms often require content providers to present information in a specific JSON schema that can be consumed by their system.

Our minds work the same way. We have various schemas in our heads. When we get an influx of information, we pull out the information to fit into the schemas in our minds. This might mean discarding a great deal of irrelevant information or unnecessary information for the particular schema. It's how our brain makes sense of what would otherwise be a chaos of sensory input and other details. Our mind constantly filters the inputs to pull only the information that maps to schemas in our heads.

This filtering of information to map to an existing mental schema can have unintended consequences. The authors explain,

> However, these mental frameworks also cause us to exclude pertinent information to focus instead only on things that confirm our pre-existing beliefs and ideas. Schemas can contribute to stereotypes and make it difficult to retain new information that does not conform to our established ideas about the world.”[What Is a Schema in Psychology?](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-a-schema-2795873)

For example, someone in a religious cult might have a mental schema that causes them to ignore certain details that don't fit into their schema while performing mental gymnastics on other details to distort them into the needed shape for the schema. The same phenomena can happen when writing a literary analysis as well. Once you get an idea of your thesis, you filter the information in the text to fit and support your thesis, ignoring details that don't fit.

Building on learning theory, X says schemas play an important role:

> "Schemas are generally thought of as ways of viewing the world and in a more specific sense, of incorporating instruction into our cognition. ...Schemas have been further described as 'mental representations of general categories of objects, events, or people.....For example, the schema of 'bottle feeding' is composed of the cognitive organization of: learning to see a shape, recognizing and categorizing it as a bottle, grasping the bottle, bringing the bottle to the mouth, and sucking on the nipple of the bottle."

In some ways, schemas seem similar to scripts theory, where we have certain expectations in our minds about a space, scenario, or text. But learning is not just about aligning with existing schemas. It's often about introducing new schemas that the user didn't already have, or rearranging the existing schemas. X explains:

> Piaget proposed that learning is the result of forming new schemas and building upon previous schemas. He proposed that two processes guide learning: (1) the organization of schemas, and (2) adaptation of schemas. He further proposed that adaptation of schemas involves: (a) the assimilation of new information into existing schemas, or (b) the accommodation of schemas to new information, which may not fit into our existing schemas.'

Mark Baker puts this another way. Building on John Carroll's Nernberg Funnel, Mark says that much of the difficult of learning is in re-arranging the user's existing mental furniture. To take the analogy a bit further, people generally have ideas about where couches and shelves and dining room tables should be arranged in their house. But suppose the learning task is to rearrange the furniture so that dining room table is in the living room, and the couch is in the bedroom, and the bookshelves are in the mudroom. This re-mapping of the mental schema creates some disorientation and cognitive strain on the user, because they can no longer just naturally fit incoming sensory data into an existing schema in their heads. This is why learning is painful and why it's not just a matter of fitting information into an existing schema. In many cases, there isn't an existing schema in user's minds to map the information to.

Thinking in schemas, we might say that users have a variety of schemas for different topics and scenarios, and when organizing and presenting information, we should be familiar with the user's schema and consider i with our new information. But these schemas aren't much of a stretch from conventions of learned experiences. The mind, in fact, has an innate schema that tends to act as an overriding pattern that pretty much all information maps well to. This leads us to the next section: story.

## The hard-wired schema

Regardless of the genre, story is the universal schema that our brains invariably try to map information to.

> We think in story. It's hardwired in our brain. it's how we make strategic sense of the otherwise overwhelming world around us.  Simply put, the brain constantly seeks meaning from all the input thrown at it, yanks out what's important for our survival on a need-to-know basis, and tells us a story about it, based on what it knows of our past experience with it, how we feel about it, and how it might affect us. ... Story is the language of experience, whether it's ours, someone else's, or that of fictional characters." [Wired for Story]

The power of story is what attracted me to major in English as an undergraduate. Sure, I liked language and characters, history and scenes. But it was story that was the attractor.

I also loved ideas, first learning critical theory as an undergraduate, and later studying creative nonfiction in graduate school. Creation nonfiction, particular the essay format, blends story with ideas in ways that engage me.

Most technical writers with humanities backgrounds love the idea of combining story with the more technical aspects of their jobs with documentation. In browsing early issues of Technical Communication, I stumbled on an issue from 1961 where a writer compares creative writing and technical writing. Many have tried to find a way to merge them, but usually come up somewhat short.

When structuring *presentations and blog posts*, story (to some degree) has been my go-to structure for as long as I can remember. It is the structure that, if you get it right, allows everything to fit into a natural place. If you can conceive of some story structure for your content, every detail naturally find the right resting place, and your content takes on a momentum and fuel of its own. If you're presenting, the story makes details stick in your head (so you don't need notes), and gives you a natural direction through a topic. Story simply works because our brains crave it.

In *Wired for Story*, Cron speculates that humans are drawn to story as an innate survival mechanism. "Story is what enabled us to imagine what might happen in the future, and so prepare for it ...." And there is a biological basis for it as well. "Breakthroughs in neuroscience reveal that our brain is hardwired to respond to story; the pleasure we derive from a tale well told is nature's way of seducing us into paying attention to it."

The *Harvard Business Review* says that narratives that develop tension (building a good story) trigger releases of Oxytocin in the brain, which increases one's empathy. When empathy increases, people are kinder to each other and more willing to cooperate, donate, or help out.

In The User's Journey, Donna Lichaw says stories are "our oldest, best tools for communicating, teaching, and engaging with people." She says:

> Story, and its underlying architecture, powers the ability to understand what happened in the past, what happens in the moment, or what will happen in the future. It’s a framework and a lens with which humans comprehend everything.
>
> Whether you plan for it or not, your customers use their story-driven brains to understand your product and what it’s like to use your product. They also use their story-driven brains to tell others about your product. The better the story, the better the experience, the better the word of mouth.
>
>More specifically, when people experience something with a story at its foundation—whether it entails watching a movie, riding a roller-coaster, or using a website—their brains are activated. They are more likely not just to have a good experience, but to:
>
> • Remember the experience.
>
> • See value in what was experienced.
>
> • See utility in what they did during that experience.
>
> • Have an easier time doing whatever they were trying to accomplish.
>
> • Want to repeat that experience.

All of this fits under the umbrella of engagement.

## Applying story to tech comm

Beyond just applying the conventions of the documentation genre, why not integrate our writing with more narrative? As I looked through all the material I'd gathered in my competitive analysis, I tried to identify elements of a story but still struggled. The problem, I began to realize, was that I was looking too granularly. I needed to step back. When I expanded the story to the user's "journey," the shape of a story fell into place more clearly.

For my scenario, the developer's journey looked more or less like this:

1. Evaluate streaming media platforms
2. Assess app development options
3. Register as a developer
4. Get oriented on the developer site
5. Consult the documentation and build the app
6. Test the app
7. Submit the app
8. Troubleshoot problems and seek help

By zooming out a bit and looking at the larger journey, more of a story emerged. How does a story differ from a journey? A journey is a series of stories, really, or more of a storymap. In The User's Journey, the author says:

> Storymapping is just what it sounds like: mapping out an intended experience of use for a product, plot point by plot point.

Granted, this isn't a gripping drama by any means. But story doesn't necessarily entail drama. Story is the story of "human struggle and eventual triumph," as the Harvard Business Review puts it. According to Cron, "A story is how what happens affects someone who is trying to achieve what turns out to be a difficult goal, and how he or she changes as a result."

Lisa Cron refers to Aristotle's work in defining a story. Aristotle says a story has three components: "characters, goals, and conflict." Cron depicts this storyline like this:

<img src="story-structure.png"/>
 (The User's Journey).

You can see elements of the Four Components model of a help topic here -- a user has a goal, there are difficulties along the path to achieving the goal, and when the user achieves the goal, the state changes.

By stepping back a bit and looking at the user's path in terms of a journey rather than a story, the larger trajectory emerges and shows more of the story.

Stepping back and showing the larger picture, I've realized, it's not a natural activity in tech comm. When we document a system, we often get lost in the details of each step. Each task has a host of granular details that must be nailed down, and when viewed alone, this zoomed-in task doesn't seem so story-like. But when you step back and view all the other tasks the user takes on this larger journey, the story emerges, and you can paint a more full picture for the user.

I think that, as a technical writer, I've fallen into the trap of focusing in on the technical details instead of describing the higher-level picture. We recently did a survey at my work to ask our users what format they preferred most &mdash; how-to topics, reference docs, step-by-step tutorials, videos. The step-by-step tutorials were the overwhelming learning preference, probably because tutorials show this larger journey through a system. A tutorial walks you through a process from beginning to end, whereas a how-to task typically describes just one activity within the system.

In "The role of cognitive theory in human-computer interface," Patricia Chalmers explains that the web interface often poses challenges for learners because they get lost in the nitty-gritty details of something; they zoom in one one piece and lose track of the big picture narrative that glues all of these pieces together. Chalmers writes,

> "Many computer users have trouble learning and remembering information presented on a computer screen. Based on cognitive theories, part of the reason for lack of retention is hypothesized to be the user's inability to form a mental picture, or schema, of the information presented via a computer screen. In order to form a schema, users need to be able to understand where newly acquired information fits into 'the big picture'. However, computers and the information on them are so infinite, users may have trouble thinking in terms of the big picture."

Painting this big picture that maps to the user's journey is key to orienting and connecting with users. Additionally, these big picture tasks that span across the system suit technical writers well, since our strength is our generalist vision, our breadth and knowledge of many different products and processes rather than a specialized knowledge of just one aspect of a product.

In mapping out the user journey using the competitor's product, I also realized that the journey our users take extends beyond the usage of our own product. When users build apps for our product, they likely also buidld apps for other products too. The language, interfaces, and workflows in these other product spaces create expectations and schemas for our product too. Understanding this larger picture across platforms is the even larger user journey.
